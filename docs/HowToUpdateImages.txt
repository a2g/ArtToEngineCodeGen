To generate these images I used a resolution of 1280x800,
Used Windows 7 drag doccking of windows to drag it to the right.
Turned off PreviewPane.

The slideshow effect is best reproduced by working backwards:
Starting at visuals/PNG Files, generating an image,
and then moving to A.java, O.java, I. java, Loader.java, Bundle.java

And then doing the same for sourceimages/PNG Files:
Animations then Objects, then Cameras, then Locations
